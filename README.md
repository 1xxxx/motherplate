This is the boilerplate HTML/CSS I'll start off any project with.

* Uses Compass to take advantage of CSS3 mixins so you don't have to worry about browser prefixes (-webkit- etc.)
* Responsive ready 12-column grid system to work across many devices
* Uses Font-Awesome icon fonts for icons; scalable...
* Uses Normalize to reset browser styles
* Only enough CSS to get you started; no visual styling so all your projects don't look the same
